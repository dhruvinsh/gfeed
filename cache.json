Modern applications are composed of multiple specialized services, each of which handles specific aspects of functionality. This shift didn’t happen overnight - it’s the result of decades of evolution in how we think about and implement data transfer between systems. Let’s explore this journey and see how it shapes modern architectures, particularly in the context of headless CMS solutions.",
